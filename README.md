Working through the book [Build a Large Language Model From Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka. 

There is also a provided [Github repo](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch). But this is me typing out and working through the sections to make sure I understand them.
